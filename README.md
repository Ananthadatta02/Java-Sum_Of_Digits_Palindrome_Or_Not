# Java-Sum_Of_Digits_Palindrome_Or_Not
This Java program checks if the sum of the digits of a given number is a palindrome. It reads an integer input, calculates the sum of its digits, and uses a helper method isPalindrome to determine if the sum is the same forwards and backwards. It then displays whether the sum is a palindrome or not.
